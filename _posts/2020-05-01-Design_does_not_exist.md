## Somebody stated that if a word erases the difference between what it is and what we imagine, we should abandon the term.

### The one.
I don't know where I am going, but the thought is too interesting to let it go unexplored. If letters can fix one idea that I can't even sketch, maybe I find a way to organize other thoughts and project myself from there. If it's true that we don't think in series, but in versions:  v.2020-05-01 22:21:52 +7

Suppose everything needs to have a starting point; mine circles in the distinction between design and exploiting design. They are as similar to each other as a pencil to a mine. If they are not the same, we can't practise them the same way.

With an open mind - or narrow, depending on the perspective - I'm more interested in the paths we open when formulating design from what it is instead of how we do it. Avoiding metaphors and agnostic to the format: Our human capacity to relate things and meaning.

 I believe, now more than ever, it is necessary to expand the conversation beyond a purely instrumental approach, confusing thinking with doing and the practice with a decision-making tool. Design does not exist until it happens.

>> Then it will exist.



### The other.
Finals always crystallize the problematic horizon, although problem, I don't think we are solving any. Maybe it's a matter of scale. 
To keep it simple, perhaps everything begins or finishes because we use the same word to express things completely different ~~with different signification levels~~.

- We use design to refer to the thing produced.  
- We use design to refer to the processes we run to produce things.
- We use design to refer to the plan we follow. 
- We use design to refer to our human capacity to create meaning.


We use it as a verb, as a noun, as an attribute, you name it. The only problem with that is that if everything is design, then nothing is design. 
_The design designed the design._

Good thing is that if design, whatever it is, exist because you and I agree that this 'thing' we've generated it's designed. Whether it's as tiny as an x or as big as a territory it requires at least two. Which it's not a bad start, except for the artists.  

From here, the mess gets more interesting. The thing is never aware of itself - try asking Siri  - It needs the rest of the system and other systems to be able to define itself. Those systems are not unique to design, neither we have agency on them. The thing makes part of design, but it's not design. 

The process used to obtain the thing does not attempt to solve any problem. But probably refine and optimize another system: production. When we manage to do something here, we mainly compose with pre-existing patterns and confusing customizing with design. Production is part of design, but it's not design. 

Before that, when there's not a clear path for production yet, most of the times, what we call the design process is, in reality, the scientific method (not design).

### The outcome.
The agreement - and, overall, the disagreement - that 'this thing we call design is design, it needs to be happening in two systems simultaneously: the mental and the physical. 

Unfortunately, an agreement in the result can not pre-exist the result itself. In the same way, consensus that something is designed can't pre-exist design.
It's a merely temporal constraint; it happens in the future. Unless....  it already exists. If it does - what occurs most of the times - plausibly means that we already have that 'thing' registered as a reference in our mental system. It'll be probably more accurate to state that we reproduce a copy —nothing to regret. 

In the end, if design is not that thing we call design, neither the processes, design systems are not such things; furthermore, we disagree on what it means. Either we drop the differentiator factor of design, and we embrace it as universal and common to all of us. Either we make a conscious exercise of signification from what we do instead of what we produce. 

And if we can not apply to ourselves our own theory, it's better to leave it behind.
