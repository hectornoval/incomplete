An organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field is
called a pattern language. This language gives a common terminology for discussing
the situations designers are faced with.

The elements of this language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes
a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes
the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this
solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

Name: ChocolateChipRatio
**Context**: You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends
Consider these patterns first: SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio
**Problem**: Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough
**Solution**: Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the
chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie
from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches,
cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips
that results in a really sturdy cookie.
**Consider next**: NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod
