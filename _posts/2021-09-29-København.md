## A set of questions used as a guideline to moderate a panel discussion in the context of a one-hour conversation taking place in Copenhagen in October 2021, where the jury takes on the debate: what is design really – the good, the bad and ugly – and where is it headed?##

### Context
Established in 2002, The Index Project foundation pushes the boundaries of design-for-good by focusing on design that solves our society's real needs – what they call 'design to improve life.' Their mission is to promote and mobilize design to improve lives through their Index Award, education programmes and impact investment funds.

### Framing
We are here celebrating proposals that Creating impact/through design to improve life.

    (1) What is design?
    (2) Why does it have the properties it has?  


We're taking - at least - two significant assumptions to be able to have this conversation:

  - That there's something called design.
    - That it exists, hence we can talk about it, recognize it, tell it is real & that we can talk about it the same way we speak about sociology, economics or history.
    - That we can put all the things we call design together under a common thread.

  - That there is a common cultural substance across nations and lifestyles to project design.

  We face the conversation acknowledging & being aware that most of our design discourse is rooted in our European' modernism'. Where design was a tool & Society was capable of transforming itself.

  Our practise is mainly based on rationalism and believes that certain principles could apply universally. We could be transferring these biases and assumptions to cultures where they might not relate.

That for us is difficult to separate design from technology innovation & markets. But each region might have different paradigms and constraints, and design discourses from the first world might not apply.

{The/a designer} design(s) {{the/a design} {{{to improve {life}}{{for}{society}}}}}
