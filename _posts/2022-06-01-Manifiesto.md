#### To start something, we need a starting point.

## In the past months, I've experienced the fragility of the systems we've been generating—lockdowns, meltdowns, breakdowns, financial collapses, gaps, social inequalities, geopolitical power shifts, and a large variety of interrelated crises. ##

These realities result from deeply entrenched ways of being, knowing and doing. A tangible probe that our wellbeing is profoundly affected by the people and the world around us. 

While we keep crossing beyond boundaries from where it'll be very complicated to recover, I find myself lacking the tools to thrive in the divergent directions we are constructing.

> I am not privileged enough to access the forefront of knowledge, but I can sense certain things are not working. 

The cultures we generate are full of blind spots —making it a challenging context to connect actions. If I can't interact, I can't make sense of it. If we can't make sense of it, it's impossible to use our natural ability to shape the world through relation and collaboration.

In other words, in such a complex scenario, it's impossible to propose alternative courses of action. Achieving a good, beneficial, durable and pleasant life is not only a matter of individual performance; it is all about collectively constructed meaning. 

If we want to act differently, we must review our intentions and change our conversations  —language is the technology we use for that. 

Suppose we aim to be aware of how we live in these artificialities of our making. In that case, we need to add a sharper consciousness of how words construct us: once we frame a complexity within the boundaries of a recognizable word, we cannot see beyond it, nor what is left behind. 
—Actions are what define us & not the words we use. Design, business, and technology are just words. 

What matters more than the system of beliefs we choose to make sense of the jumble of experiences we call life is to realize that we have one; only then will we have the power to challenge, question & change it.

If we can frame things to have a conversation around them, we can also look beyond that frame and broaden our perspectives.  

It's not an easy task; these realities are presented throughout our lives as timeless truths—conventions, practices, and traditions that are widely understood and standardized —The exercise requires deep structural reforms not to generate more ideas. 

And here I am, facing a conjuncture that does not meet my goals and purposes, searching for a path I've never experienced, looking for a new set of conditions, and exploring alternative realities. 

Acknowledging my limited agency, I'll scale down until a nested frame I have enough agency to impact with actions I am accountable for: The tradition, the disciplines, and the uses of the mainstream design discipline, which is the substrate that regulates my relationship with labour and recognition.

Because there are no signs ahead guiding the path forward and this territory is entirely new to me: I intend to use reality to guide/move the spread/extend of a thought I do not plan to formalize. 

Reality is the sole outcome of design; there is no subject, no object and no problem to be solved. All the rituals, approaches and methods surrounding the so-called discipline are mere accessories and can be left behind. There is a whole that can't be understood by looking at the parts.

My goal would be to uncover alternative paths to current linear models of exchanging value by shifting towards models that are respectful to both ourselves and the world we live in. 

Hence, I manifest:   
❏ 
Form follows context and not the other way around.    
The only thing I am by nature is incapable of doing things by myself. I am here because somebody took care of me.   
Many people have protected, nurtured, guided and provided me with the bare necessities for survival before I could even think for myself or communicate. They gave me conditions, not ideas.  
I am not alone in this world; there are limits and boundaries I should not cross when pursuing my wellbeing. We should be sitting here in identical conditions. 
I am in debt.   
◯
I am sitting here because of the knowledge and expertise I treasure, the lifestyles I followed, the contexts I lived and the choices I made in the past. If the present is the result of the past, the future will be the result of now.
I am constantly self-producing. 
I generate artificiality. I do it following the tradition, cultures and schools of thougth I've been educated about. I don't know what I don't know.
Language is the tool I use to modify my environment. I construct signs to acquire the necessary knowledge to mediate/ negotiate my relations with the environment. My process is just mine and is as valid as the other 7,953,952,575 processes. 
I can not think or express anything on behalf of anyone. 
△
	. From here, I am exploring the unknowns to find paths and directions moving forward, expecting to uncover something allowing me to expand the frame I follow to facilitate and orient decision-making.

This is all about goals & meanings and actions to be taken over time. 

I'll get somewhere.
