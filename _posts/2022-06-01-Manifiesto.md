## Everyday, we experience the fragility of the systems we've been generating: *lockdowns, meltdowns, breakdowns, collapses, inequalities, shifts, and a large variety of interrelated crises*.

What all these events have in common is that they result from deeply entrenched ways of being, knowing and doing. A tangible probe that our wellbeing is profoundly affected by the people and the world around us. 

As if these signals were insufficient, we keep crossing boundaries and threatening the fragile stability of the entire system. Risking entering a state we haven't experienced in our whole existence. Dragged into a reality that has being constructed only by a few where most of us will lack the tools to thrive moving forward.

> We are being deprived of our natural ability to shape the world through relation and collaboration.

I am not privileged enough to access the forefront of knowledge, but I can definitely sense certain things are not working, The cultures we generate are full of blind spots.  

If we can't see things, we can't interact with them. If we can't interact, we can't make sense of it. If we can't make sense of it, it's impossible to propose alternative courses of action.     

#### First, we frame.
Achieving a good, beneficial, durable and pleasant life is not only a matter of individual performance; it is all about collectively constructed meaning, language is the tool we use for that. *—If we want to act differently, we must review our intentions and change our conversations*. 

Suppose we aim to be aware of how we live in these artificialities of our making. If that's the case, we need to add a sharper consciousness of how words construct us: once we frame a complexity within the boundaries of a recognizable word, we cannot see beyond it, nor what is left behind. *—Design, business, and technology are just words*. 

What matters more than the system of beliefs we choose to make sense of the jumble of experiences we call life is to realize that we have one; only then will we have the power to challenge, question & change it.

> If we can frame things to have a conversation around them, we can also look beyond that frame and broaden our perspectives.  

#### I don't know what I don't know.
All these realities are presented throughout our lives as timeless truths—conventions, practices, and traditions that are widely understood and standardized *—The exercise requires deep structural reforms, not more ideas.* 

Acknowledging my own limitations.I find myself scaling down complexity until I reach a nested frame small enough to impact with my agency: The tradition, the disciplines, and the uses of the mainstream design practice, which is the substrate that regulates my relationship with labour and, in the end, my recognition.

And here I am, facing a conjuncture that does not meet my goals and purposes. Entering a state I've never encountered in my whole experience and looking for conditions that could take me to explore an alternative path to current linear models of exchanging value by steering towards others more respectful to ourselves and the world we live.   

Because there are no signs ahead guiding the path forward and this territory is entirely new to me: I intend to use reality to guide/move the spread/extend of a thought I do not plan to formalize. 

> Reality is the sole outcome of design; there is no subject, no object and no problem to be solved. 

All the mindsets, approaches and methods surrounding the so-called discipline can be left behind. There is a whole that can't be understood by only looking at the parts.


### Moving forward:   
**❏ I manifest: **  
- I am part of the real world, not looking at things from the outside.
- Form follows context and not the other way around.  
- The only thing I am by nature is incapable of doing things by myself. I am here because somebody took care of me.   
- Many people have protected, nurtured, guided and provided me with the bare necessities for survival before I could even think for myself or communicate. They gave me conditions, not ideas.  
- I am not alone in this world; there are limits and boundaries I should not cross when pursuing my wellbeing. We should be sitting here in identical conditions. 

**◯: I am in debt. **

- I am sitting here because of the knowledge and expertise I treasure, the lifestyles I followed, the contexts I lived and the choices I made in the past. If the present is the result of the past, the future will be the result of now.
- I am constantly self-producing. 
- I generate artificiality. 
	- I do it following the tradition, cultures and schools of thougth I've been educated about.
- I construct signs to acquire the necessary knowledge to mediate/ negotiate my relations with the environment.
-  My process is just mine and is as valid as the other 7,953,952,575 processes. 
-  I can not think or express anything on behalf of anyone. 

**△: From here**

I am exploring the unknowns to find paths and directions moving forward, expecting to uncover something allowing me to expand the frame I follow to facilitate and orient decision-making.

This is all about goals & meanings and actions to be taken over time. 

### I'll get somewhere.
