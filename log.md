For the past 45 years, my life has been in a constant state of evolution. So does the world I got to know and everyone else's life around me. In that constantly changing environment, across different cities, countries and cultures I've managed to maintain myself somewhere in betweeen academia, community work and the professional practice of design. 

In this process of acquiring knowledge and dealing with uncertainty some people call growth, 
my journey spans roles, titles and disciplines across the entire spectrum of the business.  and schools of though includes studies in Humanities and Computer sciences as well as Master thesis in building new narrative structures for multidimensional environments. No matter what the most precious learning I treasure is realizing that my wellbeing is profoundly affected by the people and the world around.

Like everybody else, I also experience the fragility of the systems others have generated —a vast amount of intended and unintended impact due to scattered ways of approaching the world that keep arising situations putting new forms of pressure on my wellbeing and the socioeconomic model sustaining it, changing the conditions I live in.

Within the boundaries of my agency, although limited, I still have some knowledge and the privilege to change some things for the better. Like everyone else, when I find myself in a situation where I have needs that do not enable me to achieve my goals… I design.

I do it exchanging value in a conversation with others. No matter if its setting the foundations from below or defining the rules of governance from above, I practice my skills modelling the structures we use to interact through systems and achieve goals.

I've experienced the business at different scales. Mostly making sense of innovation ecosystems, governance models, organisations, strategies, systems, processes, its outputs. Collaborating with others to define strategic improvements in the organisations we were delivering to.*  

Thanks to that, I've managed to gain an holistic perspective of the so called industry (inside and outside), expertise in politics and governance models, systemic design, innovation, strategy and value generation from a collaborative life centric approach that has granted me some public recognition for my work in different fields.

We don't need new frameworks to look at the world & build. We need to master the only technology we share among the entire humanity. We put it to work to modify the world, shape the environment and negotiate our relationship within it -- and, of course, our recognition. The same way we can frame things into words, we can look outside that frame and broader our perspective.The wider story is ultimately more interesting.

I tend to be and introverted but I know how to make myself comfortable in front of an audience no matter if it's singing, writing, lecturing, co-creating or facilitating complex conversations and discussions. I can do it in Spanish, English and French. However, It's not about words we use but the cultures they generate. 

Words are the frames we use to make sense of the world and shape meaning. Each of us views the world through a mental picture frame. Design, business, technology, vision, strategy, paradigms, teams, etc., are only words encapsulating our systems of beliefs.

I truly believe What matters more than the system of beliefs we choose to make sense of this world we don't know is to realise that we have one; only then we'll have the power to challenge, question & change it. 

My practice, lectures, and writing have centered on exploring the business of design and innovation, the generation of meaning and the purpose underlying our current mechanisms for value exchange. 

All that work took me to understand. We don’t need new frameworks to look at the world & build. We need to master the only technology we share among the entire humanity. We put it to work to modify the world, shape the environment and negotiate our relationship within it – and, of course, our recognition. Language.

*I have an optimistic belief that I can make it easy for others.* 

Design is a common good.

Sincerely yours.
