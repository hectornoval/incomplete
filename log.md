For the past 45 years, my life has been in a constant state of evolution. So does the world I got to know and everyone else's life around me. 

In this process of acquiring knowledge some people call maturing, I've learned and experienced that my wellbeing is profoundly affected by the people and the world around us. 

Like everyone else, I can also sense the fragility of the systems we've been generating —a vast amount of intended and unintended impact due to scattered ways of approaching the world. As a result, the conditions I live in keep changing. Arising situations put new forms of pressure on my wellbeing and the socioeconomic model sustaining it. 

Unfortunately, only some have access to the forefront of knowledge, and only some have the privilege (mental space, time, tools, network, personal wealth, and financial support) to change things. Despite that, like everyone else, when I find myself in a situation where I have needs that do not enable me to achieve my goals… I design. 

Setting the foundations from below or defining the rules of governance from above, I practice my skills modelling conditions where humans interact with systems to achieve goals. I have an optimistic belief that we can care enough about life to provide people the conditions to make it easy to thrive in this modern world: acknowledging that we are here because many people have protected, nurtured, guided and provided us with the necessities for survival before we could even think for ourselves or communicate.

We don't need new frameworks to look at the world & build. We need to master the only technology we share among the entire humanity. We put it to work to modify the world, shape the environment and negotiate our relationship within it -- and, of course, our recognition. Language.

Words are just frames we use to make sense of the world. Each of us views the world through a mental picture frame. Design, business, technology, vision, strategy, paradigms, frames, etc., are only words encapsulating our systems of beliefs.

What matters more than the system of beliefs we choose to make sense of this world we don't know is to realise that we have one; only then we'll have the power to challenge, question & change it. The same way we can frame things into words, we can look outside that frame and broader our perspective. 

The wider story is ultimately more interesting.
