Madrid, Spain 
March 2023 

Like most people, I come to this model looking for opportunities to thrive.

My life has constantly been evolving. So has the world I have known and the lives of all those around me. 

This process of acquiring knowledge to cope with the uncertainty that some call growth led me to change location, context and culture; to learn from different schools of thought and academic backgrounds in both the Humanities and Computer Science; and ultimately to sustain my life working in roles, titles and disciplines across the business of design. 

Regardless of where I have practised, the most valuable learning I treasure is the realisation that the people and the world around me profoundly affect my well-being. 

Like most people, I also experience the fragility of the systems that others generate and the enormous amount of intended and unintended impacts due to scattered ways of approaching the world. These conditions continue causing situations and exert new forms of pressure on my well-being and the socioeconomic model that sustains it.

Like everyone else, when I find myself in a situation where I have needs that do not allow me to achieve my goals... I design.

Whether it is laying the groundwork from below or defining the rules of governance from above, like any other living being, I practice my skills by modelling the structures I use to interact with the environment. I do it to achieve goals, exchanging value in conversation with others. 

I believe this can work. 

Sincerely yours.
HÃ©ctor Noval
